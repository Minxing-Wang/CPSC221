Course-Level Learning Goals

1.Analyze design tradeoffs and constraints (e.g. space/time complexity analysis) and make appropriate choices in data structures and algorithms when solving problems. (This is the mark of a good computer scientistâ€”a good computer scientist has broader design goals, such as proof of correctness, resource constraints, performance and scalability issues).

2.Expand programming language repertoire with the addition of C++; identify and exploit high-level properties across programming languages (as opposed to language-specific properties). E.g., the use of general data structures in multiple languages, the commonalities of dynamic memory allocation, parameter passing conventions, templates, etc.

3.Express and solve important problems in Computer Science using mathematical formalisms (such as discrete mathematics, functions, sets, Big-O notation, proofs, trees, graphs, e.g., link the principles of loops, recursion, and induction to establish loop/program correctness).

4.Begin integrating the topics seen previously (such as introductory programming techniques, recursion, etc) as the greater science of computers. Recognize the "bigger picture" and how the topics learned in your courses so far come together to serve computer science at large. Justify why you have learned the topics you have learned so far.
